                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> From this article, I learned that there's many different ways to creatively design to improve user interaction. Many of the interface examples show how the design helps the page look cohesive. A common pattern for this is pictures and elements that move with scrolling.  </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is how many different interface examples are provided. Its fascinating to see what the design is doing to engage the users. Each example is a different type of program and user interface is still used across all of them. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspiration is the last one, Midnight Hour by Adam Zielonko for Netguru. I chose this design because on the homepage, there is a black background with a woman wearing a black shirt acting as a division to a white page to the right. When a subpage button is clicked on, the page slides to the left and the woman is moved to the white page and resides on the left of the page. On this page, the the division to the black page is still visble. The interface successfully portrays cohesion with the division design and modernity with the sleek and simple background design.  
                            </p>
                        </li>
