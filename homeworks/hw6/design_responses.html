							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned the many different animation tactics to engage users. There are many different factors to consider, and each of these factors all contribute to the overall presentation of the webpage. The movement of objects and transitions should be fluid in order to tie together the webpage.   </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was in the Choreography in interfaces animation section. This section revealed that there are two types of ways to design a page with fluid transition. I enjoyed learning about the difference instances in which one should use which type of transition. I thought it was interesting when the article pointed out that the transitions should behave in accordance with the laws of physics.</p>
